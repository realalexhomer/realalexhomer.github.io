When I first started working in the industry, someone told me that I should screen cap everything I built so that I would have the ability to show it in a portfolio. I wish I had listened!

Unfortunately 99% of the work I did at Dubsmash is no longer available. What is left, and the screenshot provided, is just an app landing page for Dubsmash's mobile apps. Nothing we built ultimately caught on and Dubsmash made the sensible decision to stick with mobile. My web team built the landing page in the few weeks we had left before we were unfortunately laid off.

When I was at Dubsmash we built 4 separate Apollo / Typescript / React apps, depending on how you count them, on top of a couple of Node middlelayers we maintained for serving GraphQL and analytics and a Django Rest API. Dubmash.com allowed users to create and consume bite-sized pieces of video content. We also had a separate CMS for uploading the content that was being used by a dozen or so freelancers as well as our staff.

The public facing site was heavily optimized for performance and went through 3 separate complete rebuilds as our ideas pivoted. We also experimented with a few other products on web, including a way for users to edit videos online. Below is a picture and a link to the landing page that stands there today.
