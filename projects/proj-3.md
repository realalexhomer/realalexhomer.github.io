While I was at EPIX we built EPIX.com for streaming videos on the web. It hasn't changed at all since the day we worked on it, other than that they changed the hue of orange to match their new branding and they apparently broke the fixed header on the Schedule page.

We used React, Redux, and RxJs.

Also at EPIX I built an HTMl5 app for streaming movies on set top boxes, including Amazon fire devices as well as Tivos, Xboxes, SmartTVs and a host of others. That app was eventually taken down but it was one of the coolest things I have ever worked on. Since there was no mouse or keyboard, we had to map everything to a controller, which was an interesting paradigm shift. The devices were also extremely slow and laggy so we had to be very careful about performance and design the architecture pretty carefully.

The tv app was also the first time I took the technical lead on a non-minor project, which was pretty neat.
